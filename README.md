# Hi, I'm JettyCoffee! 

Currently study as a Data Science student at **East China Normal University (ECNU)**, Shanghai.  
Passionate about **AI Agents**, **Deep Learning**, and **GraphRAG on Role-Playing**.   

## Research Focus
- **AI Agent**: Designing and developing multi-agent systems with complex planning and decision-making capabilities.
- **GraphRAG on Role-Playing**: Exploring the use of LLMs and GraphRAG structures to create dynamic narratives and intelligent role-playing games.
- **iOS APP Developing**: iOS APP Developing: Building intuitive and intelligent mobile applications, with a focus on leveraging on-device AI.
- **Deep Learning**:Deep Learning: Applying advanced neural network architectures to solve real-world problems.
- **Computer Vision**:Developing algorithms for image recognition, object detection, and visual data analysis.

## Featured Projects
- **Agent Planing(Priviate)**: sophisticated framework for autonomous agents to perform complex task decomposition and execution planning.
- **[VisCGEC](https://github.com/JettyCoffee/VisCGEC)**: A visual tool designed for Chinese Grammatical Error Correction, helping users to identify and understand grammatical mistakes interactively.

## Currently Working On
- **Paimon - RoleGraphRAG**: Exploring the use of LLMs and GraphRAG structures to create dynamic narratives and intelligent role-playing games.
- **构妙 LiveCapture**: AI-powered composition assistant iOS app for intelligent photography guidance and real-time composition optimization
