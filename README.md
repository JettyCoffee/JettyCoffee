# Hi, I'm Jetty! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student at **East China Normal University (ECNU)** in Shanghai, China. When I'm not buried in code, you can find me diving into **software development**, **system architecture**, or exploring the exciting world of **AI** and **machine learning**. ðŸ¤–âœ¨

## ðŸ”§ Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Languages**: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python â€” because every hero needs a toolkit! ðŸ’»ðŸ¦¸
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: React, Next.js, Supabase â€” turning ideas into interactive magic. ðŸª„
- **Specialties**: Frontend wizardry, data visualization, and building software for **LLMs (Large Language Models)** â€” yep, I talk to machines! ðŸ’¬ðŸ¤–

## ðŸŒ± My Recent Work
- **Frontend of LLM Eco-Visualization**: A project that brings the **LLM ecosystem** to life! (Think of it like creating a digital garden of AI ðŸŒ±âœ¨)
- **CSAPP-Lab**: Hands-on learning of computer systems, assembly programming, and low-level optimizations. It's like learning to speak "binary" â€” don't worry, it's cool ðŸ˜Ž
- **Next.js with Supabase**: Building serverless apps with **Next.js** and **Supabase** â€” I promise it's as fun as it sounds! ðŸ˜œ

## ðŸš€ Let's Connect!
Iâ€™m always up for collaborating, sharing ideas, and working on cool projects. Letâ€™s build something awesome together! ðŸ‘¾ðŸ’¥

## âš¡ Fun Fact
I can write code faster than I can make coffee... but I still need that coffee to stay sane. â˜•ðŸ’»

Let's code, create, and conquer the tech world! ðŸ’ªðŸ”¥
